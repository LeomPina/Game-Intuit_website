    "tech_1": "In football matches, penalties are a battle between the goal scorer and the goalkeeper. The outcome of each penalty kick can have a significant impact on the direction of the game, and a successful penalty kick shot can often boost a team's ranking in a major tournament. When defending a penalty kick, the goalkeeper makes a judgement call based on the body movement patterns of the shooter through experience from previous matches.",

    "tech_2": "Decision Analyst scores each decision within a game and evaluates its impact on the game's direction. Both on and off-ball decisions are evaluated. Off-ball running is often overlooked compared to passing and dribbling, and can be very time consuming to analyse even if you want to, however, off-ball running is crucial for space utilisation and coverage, and affects the success of every attacking or defending play.",

    "tech_1": "在足球比赛中，点球是射门球员与守门员之间的博弈。每个点球的结果都会对比赛的走向产生重大影响，一次成功的点球射门经常能提升球队在大赛中的排名。在防守点球时，守门员会通过过往比赛的经验，根据射门球员的身体运动模式做出判断。Penalty Expert 使用人工智能算法，从大量数据中提取并分析射门球员的运动轨迹，进而帮助守门员做出最优的判断。",

    "tech_2": "Decision Analyst 评估足球比赛中每一个决策。无论是细微的跑位还是果断的传球，每个动作都有可能左右比赛的结果。尽管足球极其复杂，但球员的决策基本上可以分为两类：带球决策和无球决策。",

    "tech_3": "Pressure Quantifier 首创压力量化模型，对个体球员和球队所受对手压迫程度给出精确的量化。在足球比赛中，无论是进攻或是防守，压迫都扮演着至关重要的作用。在防守中，有效的压迫可以迫使对手丢失球权。在进攻中，是否能够在压迫下做出正确的决策并破解压迫，往往决定了该回合是否能威胁到对手的球门。",
