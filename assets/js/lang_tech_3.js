    "text_1": "<span style='color: #088F8F;'> Pressure Quantifier</span> is the first pressure quantification model that gives an accurate quantification of how much pressure individual players and teams are under from their opponents. In a football match, pressure plays a vital role in both <span style='color: #088F8F;'> attack</span> and <span style='color: #088F8F;'> defence</span>. In <span style='color: #088F8F;'> defence</span>, effective pressure can force the opponent to lose the ball. In <span style='color: #088F8F;'> attack</span>, the ability to make the proper decisions and break the pressure often determines whether or not the opponent's goal can be threatened in that turn.",
    "text_2": "With the help of the <span style='color: #088F8F;'> Pressure Quantifier</span>, you can:",
    "bul_p_1": "<span style='color: #088F8F;'>Improve team performance</span>: analyse whether the team's decisions in attack are effective in defusing pressure, and whether the team's movements in defence are effective in putting pressure on the opponent.",
    "bul_p_2": "<span style='color: #088F8F;'>Player training</span>: train players to make the right decisions under pressure; train players to make the right moves in defence to put pressure on the opponent.",
    "bul_p_3": "<span style='color: #088F8F;'>Player scoring</span>: quickly identifying players from transfer targets or youth teams who are skilled in dealing with pressure."

    "text_1": "Pressure Quantifier 首创压力量化模型，对个体球员和球队所受对手压迫程度给出精确的量化。在足球比赛中，无论是进攻或是防守，压迫都扮演着至关重要的作用。在防守中，有效的压迫可以迫使对手丢失球权。在进攻中，是否能够在压迫下做出正确的决策并破解压迫，往往决定了该回合是否能威胁到对手的球门。",
    "text_2": "借助Pressure Quantifier，您可以：",
    "bul_p_1": "提高球队表现：分析球队在进攻中的决策是否有效的化解了压迫，在防守中的移动是否给对手施加了有效的压迫。",
    "bul_p_2": "球员训练：训练球员在压力下做出正确决策的能力；训练球员在防守中进行正确的移动给对手施加有效的压迫。",
    "bul_p_3": "球员选材：从转会目标或是青年队，快速筛选出善于应对压迫的球员。"
